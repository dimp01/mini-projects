## Task - 8 Summary: Simple Sales Dashboard Design

Title:
Interactive Sales Performance Dashboard using Power BI

Objective:
The goal of this project was to design a clear and interactive sales dashboard that provides insights into sales performance across different product categories, regions, and time periods. The dashboard enables business users to track key metrics and make informed decisions efficiently.

Tools Used:

Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation

(Optional) Python with Pandas for preliminary data cleaning

Dataset: Superstore_Sales.csv


Project Highlights:

Imported and preprocessed the dataset in Power BI

Transformed the "Order Date" into Month-Year format for time-based analysis

Created interactive visuals:

Line Chart to show sales trends over time

Bar Chart to compare sales across regions

Donut Chart to visualize category-wise sales distribution


Added dynamic slicers to filter data by Region and Category

Applied effective use of colors and layout for a clean and user-friendly interface


Key Insights Derived:

1. The West region led in overall sales throughout the year.


2. The Technology category outperformed others in terms of revenue.


3. Sales peaked in November, indicating a potential seasonal or promotional impact.


4. Despite strong sales, the Central region had comparatively lower profit margins, suggesting cost or discount-related issues.



Outcome:
The completed dashboard provides a quick yet comprehensive overview of business performance, highlighting trends and outliers in sales data. It serves as a valuable tool for stakeholders to explore data interactively and support strategic planning.


Interview Question's Answers:

1. What does a dashboard do?
A dashboard visually displays key data and insights in one place, helping users quickly monitor performance and make informed decisions.


2. How do you choose the right chart?
Choose charts based on the data type and purpose — e.g., bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends over time, and pie charts for parts of a whole.


3. What is a slicer/filter?
A slicer or filter allows users to interact with the dashboard and view specific data segments, such as filtering sales by region or time period.


4. Why do we use KPIs?
KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) track important metrics to measure performance against goals and help assess business success.


5. What did your dashboard show about sales?
The dashboard showed sales trends, top-performing products or regions, peak sales periods, and areas needing improvement.


6. How do you make a dashboard look clean?
Use consistent colors, clear labels, minimal clutter, aligned elements, and focus on the most relevant visuals for clarity and readability.


7. Did you clean the data before starting?
Yes, data cleaning was done to remove duplicates, correct errors, handle missing values, and ensure consistency for accurate analysis.
