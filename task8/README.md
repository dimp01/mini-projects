## Task - 8 Summary: Simple Sales Dashboard Design


### Task Description
Design an interactive and clear sales performance dashboard using Power BI that provides actionable insights into sales across various product categories, regions, and time periods.
#
### Dataset
- **Name:** Superstore_Sales.csv
- **Content:** Contains sales, profit, product category, region, and date information for a retail superstore.
#
### Tools Used
- **Power BI:** For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Python with Pandas:** For initial data cleaning and preprocessing.
#
### Objective
To create a user-friendly dashboard that allows stakeholders to quickly understand sales performance, identify trends, and analyze sales by region, category, and time period. The dashboard should support interactive filtering and highlight key performance indicators.

#
### Project Highlights:

Imported and preprocessed the dataset in Power BI

Transformed the "Order Date" into Month-Year format for time-based analysis

**Created interactive visuals:**

- **Line Chart** to show sales trends over time

- **Bar Chart** to compare sales across regions

- **Donut Chart** to visualize category-wise sales distribution


Added dynamic slicers to filter data by Region and Category

Applied effective use of colors and layout for a clean and user-friendly interface

#

### Key Insights Derived:

1. The West region led in overall sales throughout the year.


2. The Technology category outperformed others in terms of revenue.


3. Sales peaked in November, indicating a potential seasonal or promotional impact.


4. Despite strong sales, the Central region had comparatively lower profit margins, suggesting cost or discount-related issues.

#

### Outcome / Conclusion
The resulting Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, highlighting important trends and outliers. It serves as a valuable tool for stakeholders to interactively explore data, identify areas of strength, and spot opportunities for improvement in the business.
