### Task 2 Summary: Data Visualization and Storytelling (Power BI)

In this task, I worked on creating a compelling visual story using Power BI and a sales dataset (e.g., Superstore.csv). I began by transforming and cleaning the data, establishing the necessary data connections, and preparing it for analysis.
To derive deeper insights, I used DAX functions to create new measures and built calculated columns for custom logic. I then visualized the data using a variety of visuals including charts, cards, and geo map plots, selecting the most appropriate chart types for each insight.
Throughout the process, I followed best practices in data storytelling by highlighting key takeaways, adding contextual information to visuals, and focusing on business-relevant insights rather than just aesthetics. Finally, I used the visual editor to design and decorate the dashboard, ensuring it was clean, interactive, and easy to understand.
The final output is a visual report/dashboard that effectively communicates insights through clear, engaging, and insightful storytelling.


### Interview Question's Answer:

1. What is the importance of data visualization?
Data visualization helps transform complex data into easy-to-understand visuals, enabling faster insights, better decision-making, and clearer communication.

2. When do you use a pie chart vs bar chart?
Use a pie chart to show part-to-whole relationships when comparing a few categories; use a bar chart for comparing values across multiple categories or tracking changes over time.

3. How do you make visualizations more engaging?
Use clear labels, consistent colors, interactive filters, and choose visuals that match the data type to keep users engaged and focused.

4. What is data storytelling?
Data storytelling is the practice of combining data visuals with narrative elements to convey insights clearly, make data memorable, and influence decision-making.

5. How do you avoid misleading visualizations?
Ensure accurate scales, avoid manipulating axes, use appropriate chart types, and always provide context to avoid misleading the audience.

6. What are best practices in dashboard design?
Keep it simple, prioritize key metrics, maintain consistency in design, ensure responsiveness, and use filters for interactivity.

7. What tools have you used for visualization?
I have used Power BI for creating interactive dashboards, visual reports, and sharing insights effectively.
